# Introduction

`Dockerfile` to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container image for [Freeswitch](http://freeswitch.org/).

See the `Dockerfile` for further details.

The image is based on [Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/).

## Pre-requisites
[Overlay2](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#configure-docker-with-the-overlay-or-overlay2-storage-driver) Docker storage driver.

# Getting started

Execute `run.sh`

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/voxbox/freeswitch/) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull voxbox/freeswitch:latest
```

Alternatively you can build the image yourself.

```bash
docker build -t freeswitch github.com/matteolc/docker-freeswitch
```

## Running

LimitRTTIME=infinity
= ionice -c 1 -n 2
= schedtool -R -p 89
= chrt -r 89 -a -p <pid>

### Ulimits
As we are not executing the service with systemd/sysv, we have to provide ulimits.

## Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using Docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell by starting `bash` using `docker exec` against the running container.

## Issues

Before reporting your issue please try updating Docker to the latest version and check if it resolves the issue. Refer to the Docker [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation) for instructions.

SELinux users should try disabling SELinux using the command `setenforce 0` to see if it resolves the issue.

If the above recommendations do not help then [report your issue](../../issues/new) along with the following information:

- Output of the `docker vers6` and `docker info` commands
- The `docker run` command or `docker-compose.yml` used to start the image. Mask out the sensitive bits.
- Please state if you are using [Boot2Docker](http://www.boot2docker.io), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), etc.
